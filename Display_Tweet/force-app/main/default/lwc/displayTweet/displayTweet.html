    This approach is meant as a workaround to run Twitter widgets.js despite being forbidden by locker service. 
    This relies on an iframe to load a Visualforce page which can run widgets.js
    With more time invested, this would present the tweet and leverage the existing markup as provided by twitter for a more consistent experience
