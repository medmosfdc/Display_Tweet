<!--
    This approach uses the Twitter API to get a tweet by Id and display example data, in this case it's just the text of the tweet. 
    To expand on this POC and implement in production several items need to be done:
    - Many more attributes should be displayed such as author, date, etc
    - Styling  to make it more useful as well.
    - For demo purposes, a tweet Id was hardcoded. This would be passed in dynamically by whatever component intends to use this component in a broader feature
